## Overview
An implementation of Tetris with graphics written in C++ using SDL3 with several modes, including Single Player, Local Multiplayer, Player vs AI. This project also includes a Python script to train your own Tetris playing AI models using [PPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347).

## Requirements
- Python <=3.11
- CMake >=3.22.1

## Setup
*Should in theory be cross platfrom but currently have some strange bug with windows*
### Linux
If you want to just play this game, first run the following two commands to setup the dependencies and to build the project
```
setup.sh
build.sh
```
After that run the `tetris` executable

If you want to train your own Tetris AI then I recommend creating a [virtual enviroment](https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/venv.html), activating it, and then running
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 setup.py bdist_wheel
pip install dist/*.whl
```
After the dependecies have been installed you can run `python3 src/ppo/Train.py`, if you want to change the parameters of the model then you can chnage the parameters of the `TetrisPPOTrainer` inside the train script

If you wish to visualise your AI models training data then you can run 
```
python3 src/ppo/Visualisation.py --help
```
and then select the options to display the data you want. For example if you want to see the average reward overtime with a rolling average of 10, simply run  
```
python3 src/ppo/Visualisation.py --reward --rolling-average 10
```

If you wish to see your model play an actual game you can use the `src/ppo/Test.py` file, all you need to do is change the file path which is being loaded by the trainer to the path of your models save file.
